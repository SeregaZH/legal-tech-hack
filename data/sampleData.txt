Institutions are expected to meet this requirement continuously and hold a stock of unencumbered HQLA as a defense against the potential onset of liquidity stress. During a period of financial stress, however, OSFI reaffirms the view of the BCBS that institutions may use their stock of HQLA, thereby falling below 100%, as maintaining the LCR at 100% under such circumstances could produce undue negative effects on the institution and other market participants. OSFI will subsequently assess this situation and will adjust its response flexibly according to the circumstances, as described in Chapter 2, paragraph 6. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 17] The minimum LCR requirement for Canadian institutions is set at 100%, beginning January 1, 2015 – i.e. no phase-in period will be permitted.

  "body": "This guideline covers multiple quantitative liquidity measures including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) supervisory tool, a suite of additional liquidity monitoring tools, and a set of intraday liquidity monitoring tools. Each of these liquidity measures offers a different perspective on the liquidity adequacy of an institution as no one measure can, on its own, present a comprehensive picture. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio is a standard that aims to ensure that an institution has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets, to meet its liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. At a minimum, the stock of unencumbered HQLA should enable the institution to survive until Day 30 of the stress scenario, by which time it is assumed that appropriate corrective actions can be taken by management and supervisors, or that the institution can be resolved in an orderly way. Furthermore, it gives the central bank additional time to take appropriate measures, should they be regarded as necessary. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 16] The Net Stable Funding Ratio is a standard that requires institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. A sustainable funding structure is intended to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to an institution's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that would increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. The NSFR aims to limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding, encourages better assessment of funding risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items, and promotes funding stability. In addition, the NSFR approach offsets incentives for institutions to fund their stock of liquid assets with short-term funds that mature just outside the LCR's 30-day horizon. [BCBS Oct 2014, para 1] The Net Cumulative Cash Flow is a tool that measures an institution's cash flows beyond the 30 day horizon in order to capture the risk posed by funding mismatches between assets and liabilities, after the application of assumptions around the functioning of assets and modified liabilities (i.e. where rollover of certain liabilities is permitted). The NCCF measures an institution's cash flow horizon both on the basis of the consolidated balance sheet as well as by major individual balance sheets and components. The metric helps identify gaps between contractual inflows and outflows for various time bands over and up to a 12 month time horizon, which indicate potential liquidity shortfalls an institution may need to address. A suite of additional liquidity monitoring tools, discussed in paragraphs 11 to 17 are utilized to capture specific information related to an institution's cash flows, balance sheet structure, available unencumbered collateral, and certain market indicators as well as an institution's intraday liquidity positions. The contractual maturity mismatch profile identifies the gaps between the contractual inflows and outflows of liquidity for defined time bands. These maturity gaps indicate how much liquidity an institution would potentially need to raise in each of these time bands if all outflows occurred at the earliest possible date. The NCCF, as described above and outlined in Chapter 4, provides such a maturity mismatch metric. This metric provides insight into the extent to which the institution relies on maturity transformation under its current contracts. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 177] The concentration of funding metrics are meant to identify those sources of wholesale funding that are of such significance that withdrawal of this funding could trigger liquidity problems. The metric thus encourages the diversification of funding sources as recommended in the BCBS's Sound Principles and OSFI's Guideline B-6: Liquidity Principles. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 188] Metrics related to available unencumbered assets provide data on the quantity and key characteristics, including currency denomination and location, of institutions' available unencumbered assets. These assets have the potential to be used as collateral to raise additional HQLA or secured funding in secondary markets or are eligible at central banks and as such may potentially be additional sources of liquidity for the institution. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 201] The LCR by significant currency metric allows both the institution and OSFI to track potential currency mismatch issues that could arise. A currency is considered \"significant\" if the aggregate liabilities denominated in that currency amount to 5% or more of the institution's total liabilities. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 209 and para 211] The market-related monitoring tools provide OSFI with high frequency market data with little or no time lag which can be used as early warning indicators in monitoring potential liquidity difficulties at institutions. This includes the monitoring of data at the following market-wide, financial sector, and institution-specific levels to focus on potential liquidity difficulties. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 214 and para 215] The Liquidity Activity Monitor (LAM) provides OSFI with timely balances of key accounts for select institutions, as determined by OSFI. The intraday liquidity monitoring tools enable OSFI and the Bank of Canada, as applicable (see Chapter 6), to better monitor an institution's management of intraday liquidity risk and its ability to meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis. Over time, the tools will also provide OSFI and the Bank of Canada with a better understanding of institutions' payment and settlement behaviour.

These maturity gaps indicate how much liquidity an institution would potentially need to raise in each of these time bands if all outflows occurred at the earliest possible date. The NCCF, as described above and outlined in Chapter 4, provides such a maturity mismatch metric. This metric provides insight into the extent to which the institution relies on maturity transformation under its current contracts. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 177]contractual maturity mismatchThe concentration of funding metrics are meant to identify those sources of wholesale funding that are of such significance that withdrawal of this funding could trigger liquidity problems. The metric thus encourages the diversification of funding sources as recommended in the BCBS's Sound Principles and OSFI's Guideline B-6: Liquidity Principles. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 188]concentration of fundingSound PrinciplesGuideline B-6: Liquidity PrinciplesMetrics related to available unencumbered assets provide data on the quantity and key characteristics, including currency denomination and location, of institutions' available unencumbered assets. These assets have the potential to be used as collateral to raise additional HQLA or secured funding in secondary markets or are eligible at central banks and as such may potentially be additional sources of liquidity for the institution. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 201]available unencumbered assetsThe LCR by significant currency metric allows both the institution and OSFI to track potential currency mismatch issues that could arise. A currency is considered \"significant\" if the aggregate liabilities denominated in that currency amount to 5% or more of the institution's total liabilities. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 209 and para 211]LCR by significant currencyThe market-related monitoring tools provide OSFI with high frequency market data with little or no time lag which can be used as early warning indicators in monitoring potential liquidity difficulties at institutions. This includes the monitoring of data at the following market-wide, financial sector, and institution-specific levels to focus on potential liquidity difficulties. [BCBS Jan 2013, para 214 and para 215]market-related monitoring toolsThe Liquidity Activity Monitor (LAM) provides OSFI with timely balances of key accounts for select institutions, as determined by OSFI.Liquidity Activity MonitorThe intraday liquidity monitoring tools enable OSFI and the Bank of Canada, as applicable (see Chapter 6), to better monitor an institution's management of intraday liquidity risk and its ability to meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis. Over time, the tools will also provide OSFI and the Bank of Canada with a better understanding of institutions' payment and settlement behaviour.intraday liquidity monitoring tools",
