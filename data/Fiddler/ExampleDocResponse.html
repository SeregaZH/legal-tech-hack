For reference, the Basel text paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph.\n</li> <li>  Management of intraday liquidity risk forms a key element of an institution’s overall liquidity risk management framework as outlined in BCBS Sound Principles and OSFI’s Guideline B-6: Liquidity Principles.\n </li> <li> Specifically, Principle 8 of the Sound Principles and Principle 12 of OSFI’s Guideline B-6: Liquidity Principles state that “a bank should actively manage its intraday liquidity positions and risks to meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis under both normal and stressed conditions and thus contribute to the smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems.” Moreover, six operational elements that should be included in a bank’s strategy for managing intraday liquidity risk are identified:\n <ol style=list-style-type:lower-roman!important;> <li> have the capacity to measure expected daily gross liquidity inflows and outflows, anticipate the intraday timing of these flows where possible, and forecast the range of potential net funding shortfalls that might arise at different points during the day;\n </li> <li> have the capacity to monitor intraday liquidity positions against expected activities and available resources (balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, available collateral);\n</li> <li> arrange to acquire sufficient intraday funding to meet its intraday objectives;\n</li> <li>  have the ability to manage and mobilise collateral as necessary to obtain intraday funds;\n</li> <li>  have a robust capability to manage the timing of its liquidity outflows in line with its intraday objectives; \n</li> <li> and be prepared to deal with unexpected disruptions to its intraday liquidity flows. [BCBS April 2013, para 1 and para 2]\n</li> </ol></li> <li>  The BCBS, in consultation with the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSSFootnote 4), has developed a set of quantitative tools to enable supervisors to monitor institutions’ intraday liquidity risk and their ability to meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis under both normal and stressed conditions. The monitoring tools will complement the qualitative guidance in the BCBS Sound Principles and OSFI’s Guideline B-6: Liquidity Principles. [BCBS April 2013, para 4]\n</li><li> Given the close relationship between the management of institutions’ intraday liquidity risk and the smooth functioning of payment and settlement systemsFootnote 5, the tools will also be of benefit to central bank or other authorities responsible for the oversight of payment and settlement systems (overseers). It is envisaged that the introduction of monitoring tools for intraday liquidity will lead to closer co-operation between banking supervisors and the overseers in the monitoring of banks’ payment behaviour. [BCBS April 2013, para 5]\n</li><li> It is important to note that the tools are being introduced for monitoring purposes only. Internationally active institutions will be required to apply these tools. These tools may also be useful in promoting sound liquidity management practices for other institutions, whether they are direct participantsFootnote 6 of a large-value payment system (LVPS)Footnote 7 or use a correspondent bank to settle payments. National supervisors will determine the extent to which the tools apply to non-internationally active banks within their jurisdictions. [BCBS April 2013, para 6]\n</li><li> Consistent with their broader liquidity risk management responsibilities, institution management will be responsible for collating and submitting the monitoring data for the tools to their supervisor.Footnote 8 It is recognised that institutions may need to liaise closely with counterparts, including payment system operators and correspondent banks, to collate these data. However, institutions and supervisors are not required to disclose these reporting requirements publicly. Public disclosure is not intended to be part of these monitoring tools.

Monitoring tools applicable to all reporting institutions</h2> (i) Daily maximum intraday liquidity usage \n <ol start=12> <li> This tool will enable supervisors to monitor an institution’s intraday liquidity usage in normal conditions. It will require institutions to monitor the net balance of all payments made and received during the day over their settlement account, either with the central bank (if a direct participant) or over their account held with a correspondent bank (or accounts, if more than one correspondent bank is used to settle payments). The largest net negative position during the business day on the account(s), (i.e. the largest net cumulative balance between payments made and received), will determine an institution’s maximum daily intraday liquidity usage. The net position should be determined by settlement time stamps (or the equivalent) using transaction-by-transaction data over the account(s). The largest net negative balance on the account(s) can be calculated after close of the business day and does not require real-time monitoring throughout the day. [BCBS April 2013, para 13] </li> \n <li>For illustrative purposes only, the calculation of the tool is shown in Figure 1. A positive net position signifies that the institution has received more payments than it has made during the day. Conversely, a negative net position signifies that the institution has made more payments than it has received.Footnote 14 For direct participants, the net position represents the change in its opening balance with the central bank. For institutions that use one or more correspondent banks, the net position represents the change in the opening balance on the account(s) with its correspondent bank(s). [BCBS April 2013, para 14]</li> \n <li> Assuming that an institution runs a negative net position at some point intraday, it will need access to intraday liquidity to fund this balance. The minimum amount of intraday liquidity that an institution would need to have available on any given day would be equivalent to its largest negative net position. (In the illustration above, the intraday liquidity usage would be 10 units.) [BCBS April 2013, para 15]</li> \n <li> Conversely, when an institution runs a positive net cumulative position at some point intraday, it has surplus liquidity available to meet its intraday liquidity obligations. This position may arise because the institution is relying on payments received from other LVPS participants to fund its outgoing payments. (In the illustration above, the largest positive net cumulative position would be 8.6 units.) [BCBS April 2013, para 16]</li> \n <li> Institutions should report their three largest daily negative net cumulative positions on their settlement or correspondent account(s) in the reporting period and the daily average of the negative net cumulative position over the period. The largest positive net cumulative positions, and the daily average of the positive net cumulative positions, should also be reported. As the reporting data accumulates, supervisors will gain an indication of the daily intraday liquidity usage of an institution in normal conditions. [BCBS April 2013, para 17]</li> \n (ii) Available intraday liquidity at the start of the business day \n <li> This tool will enable supervisors to monitor the amount of intraday liquidity an institution has available at the start of each day to meet its intraday liquidity requirements in normal conditions. Institutions should report both the three smallest sums by value of intraday liquidity available at the start of each business day in the reporting period, and the average amount of available intraday liquidity at the start of each business day in the reporting period. The report should also break down the constituent elements of the liquidity sources available to the institution. [BCBS April 2013, para 18]</li> \n <li> Drawing on the liquidity sources set out in Section 6.1.B, institutions should discuss and agree with their supervisor the sources of liquidity which they should include in the calculation of this tool. Where institutions manage collateral on a cross-currency and/or cross-system basis, liquidity sources not denominated in the currency of the intraday liquidity usage and/or which are located in a different jurisdiction, may be included in the calculation if the institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of its supervisor that the collateral can be transferred intraday freely to the system where it is needed. [BCBS April 2013, para 19] </li> \n <li>As the reporting data accumulates, supervisors will gain an indication of the amount of intraday liquidity available to an institution to meet its payment and settlement obligations in normal conditions. [BCBS April 2013, para 20]</li> \n (iii) Total payments \n <li> This tool will enable supervisors to monitor the overall scale of an institution’s payment activity. For each business day in a reporting period, institutions should calculate the total of their gross payments sent and received in the LVPS and/or, where appropriate, across any account(s) held with a correspondent bank(s). Institutions should report the three largest daily values for gross payments sent and received in the reporting period and the average daily figure of gross payments made and received in the reporting period. [BCBS April 2013, para 21]</li> \n (iv) Time-specific obligations\n <li> This tool will enable supervisors to gain a better understanding of an institution’s time specific obligations.Footnote 15 Failure to settle such obligations on time could result in financial penalty, reputational damage to the institution or loss of future business. [BCBS April 2013, para 22]</li> \n <li> Institutions should calculate the total value of time-specific obligations that they settle each day and report the three largest daily total values and the average daily total value in the reporting period to give supervisors an indication of the scale of these obligations.

[BCBS April 2013, para 31] </li> \n (ii) Counterparty stress: a major counterparty suffers an intraday stress event which prevents it from making payments \n <li> A counterparty stress may result in direct participants and institutions that use correspondent banking services being unable to rely on incoming payments from the stressed counterparty, reducing the availability of intraday liquidity that can be sourced from the receipt of the counterparty’s payments. [BCBS April 2013, para 32]</li> \n (iii) A customer bank’s stress: a customer bank of a correspondent bank suffers a stress event \n <li> A customer bank’s stress may result in other institutions deferring payments to the customer, creating a further loss of intraday liquidity at its correspondent bank. [BCBS April 2013, para 33] </li> \n (iv) Market-wide credit or liquidity stress \n <li> A market-wide credit or liquidity stress may have adverse implications for the value of liquid assets that an institution holds to meet its intraday liquidity usage. A widespread fall in the market value and/or credit rating of an institution’s unencumbered liquid assets may constrain its ability to raise intraday liquidity from the central bank. In a worst case scenario, a material credit downgrade of the assets may result in the assets no longer meeting the eligibility criteria for the central bank’s intraday liquidity facilities. [BCBS April 2013, para 34] </li> \n <li> For an institution that uses correspondent banking services, a widespread fall in the market value and/or credit rating of its unencumbered liquid assets may constrain its ability to raise intraday liquidity from its correspondent bank(s). [BCBS April 2013, para 35]</li> \n <li> Institutions which manage intraday liquidity on a cross-currency basis should consider the intraday liquidity implications of a closure of, or operational difficulties in, currency swap markets and stresses occurring in multiple systems simultaneously.

Scope of application</h2> \n <ol start=40><li>Institutions generally manage their intraday liquidity risk on a system-by-system basis in a single currency, but it is recognised that practices differ across institutions and jurisdictions, depending on the institutional set up of an institution and the specifics of the systems in which it operates. The following considerations aim to help institutions and supervisors determine the most appropriate way to apply the tools. Should institutions need further clarification, they should discuss the scope of application with their supervisors. [BCBS April 2013, para 41]</li> \n  (i) Systems \n <li> Institutions which are direct participants to an LVPS can manage their intraday liquidity in very different ways. Some institutions manage their payment and settlement activity on a system-by-system basis. Others make use of direct intraday liquidity ‘bridges’ between LVPS, which allow excess liquidity to be transferred from one system to another without restriction. Other formal arrangements exist, which allow funds to be transferred from one system to another (such as agreements for foreign currency liquidity to be used as collateral for domestic systems). [BCBS April 2013, para 42] </li> \n <li> To allow for these different approaches, direct participants should apply a ‘bottom-up’ approach to determine the appropriate basis for reporting the monitoring tools. The following sets out the principles which such institutions should follow:<ul> <li>As a baseline, individual institutions should report on each LVPS in which they participate on a system-by-system-basis; </li> \n <li>If there is a direct real-time technical liquidity bridge between two or more LVPS, the intraday liquidity in those systems may be considered fungible. At least one of the linked LVPS may therefore be considered an ancillary system for the purpose of the tools;</li> \n <li> If an institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of its supervisor that it regularly monitors positions and uses other formal arrangements to transfer liquidity intraday between LVPS which do not have a direct technical liquidity bridge, those LVPS may also be considered as ancillary systems for reporting purposes. [BCBS April 2013, para 43]</li> </ul></li> \n <li> Ancillary systems (e.g. retail payment systems, CLS, some securities settlement systems and central counterparties), place demands on an institution’s intraday liquidity when these systems settle the institution’s obligations in an LVPS. Consequently, separate reporting requirements will not be necessary for such ancillary systems. [BCBS April 2013, para 44] </li> \n <li>Institutions that use correspondent banking services should base their reports on the payment and settlement activity over their account(s) with their correspondent bank(s). Where more than one correspondent bank is used, the institution should report per correspondent bank. For institutions which access an LVPS indirectly through more than one correspondent bank, the reporting may be aggregated, provided that the reporting institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of its supervisor that it is able to move liquidity between its correspondent banks. [BCBS April 2013, para 45]</li> \n <li> Institutions which operate as direct participants of an LVPS but which also make use of correspondent banks should discuss whether they can aggregate these for reporting purposes with their supervisor. Aggregation may be appropriate if the payments made directly through the LVPS and those made through the correspondent bank(s) are in the same jurisdiction and same currency. [BCBS April 2013, para 46]</li> \n (ii) Currency \n <li>Institutions that manage their intraday liquidity on a currency-by-currency basis should report on an individual currency basis. [BCBS April 2013, para 47] </li> \n <li>If an institution can prove to the satisfaction of its supervisor that it manages liquidity on a cross-currency basis and has the ability to transfer funds intraday with minimal delay – including in periods of acute stress – then the intraday liquidity positions across currencies may be aggregated for reporting purposes. However, institutions should also report at an individual currency level so that supervisors can monitor the extent to which firms are reliant on foreign exchange swap markets. [BCBS April 2013, para 48]</li> \n <li> When the level of activity of an institution’s payment and settlement activity in any one particular currency is considered de minimis with the agreement of the supervisor a reporting exemption could apply and separate returns need not be submitted. [BCBS April 2013, para 49]</li> \n (iii) Organisational structure \n <li> The appropriate organisational level for each institution’s reporting of its intraday liquidity data should be determined by the supervisor, but it is expected that the monitoring tools will typically be applied at a significant individual legal entity level. The decision on the appropriate entity should consider any potential impediments to moving intraday liquidity between entities within a group, including the ability of supervisory jurisdictions to ring-fence liquid assets, timing differences and any logistical constraints on the movement of collateral. [BCBS April 2013, para 50]</li> \n <li> Where there are no impediments or constraints to transferring intraday liquidity between two (or more) legal entities intraday, and institutions can demonstrate this to the satisfaction of their supervisor, the intraday liquidity requirements of the entities may be aggregated for reporting purposes. [BCBS April 2013, para 51]</li> \n (iv) Responsibility of home and host supervisors \n <li> For cross-border banking groups, where an institution operates in LVPS and/or with a correspondent bank(s) outside the jurisdiction where it is domiciled, both home and host supervisors will have an interest in ensuring that the institution has sufficient intraday liquidity to meet its obligations in the local LVPS and/or with its correspondent bank(s). The allocation of responsibility between home and host supervisor will ultimately depend upon whether the institution operating in the non-domestic jurisdiction does so via a branch or a subsidiary.</li></ol> \n <h3>For a branch operation</h3> \n <ul> <li> The home (consolidated) supervisor should have responsibility for monitoring through the collection and examination of data that its banking groups can meet their payment and settlement responsibilities in all countries and all currencies in which they operate. The home supervisor should therefore have the option to receive a full set of intraday liquidity information for its banking groups, covering both domestic and non-domestic payment and settlement obligations.</li> \n <li> The host supervisor should have the option to require foreign branches in their jurisdiction to report intraday liquidity tools to them, subject to materiality.</li> </ul> \n <h3>For a subsidiary active in a non-domestic LVPS and/or correspondent bank(s)</h3> \n <ul> <li>The host supervisor should have primary responsible for receiving the relevant set of intraday liquidity data for that subsidiary.</li> \n <li> The supervisor of the parent institution (the home consolidated supervisor) will have an interest in ensuring that a non-domestic subsidiary has sufficient intraday liquidity to participate in all payment and settlement obligations. The home supervisor should therefore have the option to require non-domestic subsidiaries to report intraday liquidity data to them as appropriate.
